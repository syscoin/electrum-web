Statement regarding ElectrumSys and Syscoin
=============================================

July 26th, 2017.

Electrum is a wallet created by Thomas Voegtlin in 2011.
Electrum is distributed by Electrum Technologies GmbH, a company
registered in Germany, using the website https://electrum.org

ElectrumSys is the syscoin version of the wallet developed by sidhujag
in 2020. You can visit the site at https://syscoin.electrum.org for more info.


Multiple chain validation
-------------------------

ElectrumSys is a SPV wallet, which means that it verifies and stores a
sequence of block headers sent by the Syscoin network, and uses these
headers to verify that transactions are in the Syscoin blockchain.

A new feature in ElectrumSys 2.9 is Multiple Chain Validation
(MCV). Instead of validating a single sequence of block headers,
ElectrumSys 2.9 validates a tree of headers, sent by ElectrumSys servers
that may follow different branches of a fork in the Syscoin
blockchain.

The purpose of MCV is to detect blockchain forks that would otherwise
be invisible to the classical SPV model, and to let users choose
between branches of such a fork. In particular, this feature has been
designed for the BIP148 soft fork, or for the Segwit2x block size
increase.

However, 'Multiple Chain Validation' still includes 'Validation'. In
particular, it assumes that both branches of a fork are valid from the
perspective of a SPV wallet, because they both follow the Syscoin
rules.



How to redeem my BCC?
---------------------

BCC wallets will require you to import your seed or your private keys,
which can be exported from ElectrumSys. Doing so will expose all your
Syscoin funds associated with that seed to the BCC wallet you decide
to use.

Therefore, *after* the BCC fork, but *before* you enter a seed or
private key in a BCC wallet, you should move all your funds to a new
ElectrumSys wallet, with a new seed. You will still be able to use the
old seed or private key with BCC, because BCC has replay
protection. Wait until your funds are confirmed in your new Syscoin
wallet, before you enter the old private key in a BCC wallet. This
will protect your BTC funds from rogue/untrusted software.
